If you have to update tests every time you change something, 
then that is a sign of "brittle tests"
You should test behaviors, NOT implementations
Remember - your tests should know as little as possible about
the internals.  They should only interact with your API.

Tests don't know about your helper methods, etc.


If you aren't scared of your own codebase, wait til you build
larger projects
"But it works right now - I will break everything if I break it."
