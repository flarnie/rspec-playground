-----This is a big project

 * Rails App
 * RSpec BDD 
 * Meaning Integration Tests
 * Git (!)
 
 * Goal Setting App (similar to 43things.com)
 
 
-----RSpec BDD

BDD vs. TDD

Unit Tests vs. Integration Tests

Unit: one feature or piece of the app (models, the Post controller, etc.)
Integration: user side behavior of the app
and/or many things working together

There is more to all of this than we are telling you.
Mozilla uses 1ks of tests

-----Git

QQQ - who has been using git?

QQQ - Should I demo git setup?

In this project we use git branches and merging for one phase.

Demo git branch
Making commits on branch
merging branch back in

QQQ - Should I demo github, setting up a remote repo?

-----User Integration tests

!!! Mention request specs - tests controller routes 
you have a reading on this
know they exist

--You can test JS stuff with Capybara (next week)

Think (Don't look at!, but think) of the assessment04 specs.

Those actually visited pages in your app and tested out the behavior of the app.

QQQ - If we want to write that kind of test for auth, what should it do?

/spec/features/auth_spec.rb

describe "the signup process" do 

  it "has a new user page"

  describe "signing up a user" do

    it "shows username on the homepage after signup"

  end

end

describe "logging in" do 

  it "shows username on the homepage after login"

end

describe "logging out" do 

  it "begins with logged out state"

  it "doesn't show username on the homepage after logout"

end

You will actually write the tests for these.
I'll just demo one -
(Methods to use:)
before(:each) do... 
visit url
fill_in 'field_name', :with => "thing"
click_on "Create User"
expect(page).to have_content "blah"

Test one thing at a time as much as possible!!!


-----Goal Setting App

Users, Goals, Cheers
QQQ - Does this all make sense?
